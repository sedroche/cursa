<a name="about-cursa" class="anchor" href="#about-cursa"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About cursa</h2>

<p>The idea for cursa came from the area of static blogging, which has taken off amongst developers who like to blog.  Static blogging generators like <a href="http://nanoc.ws/">nanoc</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org/">octopress</a> were used as inspiration for how the look and feel of cursa would work.</p>

<p>Static blogging has its advantages over more complex blogging engines such as WordPress or Blogger. One of the advantages is that static blog generators are lightweight programs in comparison to some blogging engines. To run WordPress locally for example, you need to install an SQL database - just for blogging! Of course, you can use the web based versions of Wordpress and Blogger but these versions limit the access that the user has to the created content. You create the content in the web editor, but it is stored on their servers limiting your access to the content and control over the content. With a static blog generator the files are stored locally which gives greater control over the content. Another big advantage is that the content can be stored in a git repository where full versioning can take place.</p>

<p>The education domain has some of the same issues. When a lecturer needs to create a course they will create the content and store it in a virtual learning environment like Moodle. Moodle would be comparable to the web based Wordpress or Blogger. Once the course is stored in Moodle the lecturer no longer has full control over the content and cannot transfer content from one course to another. The lecturer could run their own local copy of Moodle to store the content but again Moodle is a bloated piece of software which should not be needed just to create a course.</p>

<p>So this is where cursa comes in. As nanoc and octopress are to blogging, cursa is to course creation. cursa is a course generator that allows the user to create a course locally allowing full control of the content (with all the advantages of git versioning). The locally created course can then be edited and perfected before being pushed to a live Moodle installation where the students can access the content</p>

        <h2> Creating a Course</h2>
		<p>
			When creating a course there are a few concepts that you need to know. A course is divided into sections.
			A course is composed of a collection of modules, a module then is composed of a collection of topics and a topic is composed of a collection of Labs.
			Cursa allows you to create and manipulate each section independently for maximum flexibility.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cursa is a command-line application and has three commands;
		</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li><a href='#scaffold'>scaffold - creates the file structure</a></li>
				<li><a href='#build'>build - transforms markdown content into different output formats</a></li>
				<li>push - push built output to a virtual learning environment(Moodle)</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3 id="scaffold">Cursa scaffold</h3>
		<p>
			A Cursa course is a directory with a specific structure. In this tutorial, we’ll create a module named 'computing'. 
			To create this module, create a directory in your home directory called 'cursa'. This directory will contain your modules
			and the Cursa commands will only work inside this directory.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Now from within the cursa directory, type into the terminal:
		</p>
		
		<pre>
			$ cursa scaffold computing
		</pre>

		<p> The cursa program will know where in the directory structure you are and will create the appropriate course section</p>
		<p> As this is the top level, cursa will create the file structure for a module.</p>
		<p> The structure of the module is shown next;</p>

		<pre>
			computing
			    ├── assets
			    │   ├── css
			    │   │   ├── bootstrap.min.css
			    │   │   ├── bootstrap-responsive.min.css
			    │   │   └── cursa.css
			    │   └── js
			    │       ├── bootstrap.min.js
			    │       ├── highlight.pack.js
			    │       └── jquery-1.7.2.min.js
			    ├── index.yaml
			    └── topics


		</pre>

		<p>
		    Cursa has created all the relevant files and directories associated with a module. 
		    Within the computing module, cursa has created an empty topics directory. This folder with contain all the topics that make up the computing module.
		    From within this directory you can create the structure for your topics.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Now navigate to the topics directory in your terminal and type:
		</p>

		<pre>
			$ cursa scaffold programming
		</pre>
		<p>
		    This is the same command as for creating a module, but cursa knows its location in the directory and will scaffold the structure for a topic.
		</p
		<p> The structure of the topic is shown next;</p>
		<pre>
		    programming
		    ├── assets
		    │   ├── css
		    │   └── js
		    ├── index.md
		    ├── index.yaml
		    ├── labs
		    └── presentations
			├── html
			│   └── assets
			│       ├── css
			│       └── js
			├── md
			└── pdf
		</pre>

		<p> Again Cursa created all the relevant files and directories associated with a topic.
		    Do not worry about what these folders and files are for. That will all will be explained in the build tutorial.
		</p>
		<p>
		    The final section to scaffold will be a lab.
		    Cursa has created an empty labs directory within the programming directory to house the labs for the topic.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Navigate to the labs directory in your terminal and type:
		</p>

		<pre>
			$ cursa scaffold eclipse_tutorial
		</pre>
		<p>
		    This is the same command as for creating a module and topic but again cursa knows its location in the directory and will scaffold the structure for a lab.
		</p
		<p> The structure of the lab is shown next;</p>
		<pre>
		            eclipse_tutorial
			    ├── archives
			    ├── html
			    │   └── assets
			    │       ├── css
			    │       └── js
			    ├── img
			    ├── index.yaml
			    ├── md
			    │   ├── Exercises.md
			    │   ├── Objectives.md
			    │   └── RENAME-STEP.md
			    └── pdf
		</pre>
		<p>
		Cursa has now created the directory structure for the module. Each module can contain many topics and each topic can cntain many labs.
		Cursa allows you the flexibility to create whatever module structure you need. All the files and directories have a purpose which will been shown in the build tutorial.
                </p>

		<h3 id="build">Cursa build</h3>
		<h4>Lab</h4>
		<p>
		The first build we will do is to build a lab.
		A lab is a practical/hands-on learning element of a topic where the student must complete a set of steps to gain experience with a subject matter.
		What happens when we build a lab is that the content - which is written in Markdown - is transformed into HTML output.
		This allows you to concentrate on creating the content and not waste time on the presentation element.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the eclipse_tutorial directory you just scaffolded there is a directory named 'md'.
		This folder will contain the markdown files that will be the source of the content for the lab.
		Each markdown file will represent a 'step' in the lab. Cursa has autogenerated some markdown files for you already.
		Each lab will usually outline the objectives for the lab and some exercises at the end.
		</p>
		<pre>
			  ├── index.yaml
			  ├── md
			      ├── Exercises.md
			      ├── Objectives.md
			      └── RENAME-STEP.md
		</pre>
		<p>
		   For every markdown 'step' in the md directory, a HTML output of that content will be generated and placed in the html directory.
		</p>
		<pre>
			    ├── html
			    │   └── assets
			    │       ├── css
			    │       └── js
		</pre>
		<p>
		   The HTML output will be styled using <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/"> Twitter Bootstrap</a>.
		   The files for which will be placed in the assets directories within the html directory.
		   The HTML output will have a navigation bar to connect the individual HTML files which will allow the student to easily step through the lab. 
		</p>

		<p>
		The 'img' directory will contain any images that you need to reference within the HTML output. Any images that you use to demonstrate the lab will be put in here.
		</p>

		<p>
		Although the HTML output is very user-friendly and intuitive, some students prefer to have a physical copy of the lab to work through.
		When a build of a lab is made, a PDF version of the lab is also generated. This PDF version will be placed in the pdf directory.
		This PDF can then be printed by the students who prefer that format.
		</p>
		<p>
		A sample lab for you to build is provided <a href="./archives/eclipse_tutorial.tar.gz"> here</a>. Extract the folder and replace your eclipse_tutorial directory with this directory.
		</p>
		<p>
		This sample lab contains markdown files with content.
		</p>
		<pre>
			├── md
			   ├── exercises.md
			   ├── objectives.md
			   ├── step01.md
			   ├── step02.md
			   ├── step03.md
			   ├── step04.md
			   ├── step05.md
			   ├── step06.md
			   ├── step07.md
			   ├── step08.md
			   └── step09.md
		</pre>
		<p>
		If you did not download the sample lab an example of the markdown can be seen <a href="./markdown/step03.txt">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And the 'img' and 'archive' directories contain the images and archives.
		</p>
		<pre>
			── archives
			   ├── cstyle.xml
			   ├── jettison-1.3.2.jar
			   ├── lab01projects.zip
			   ├── stax-1.2.0.jar
			   └── xstream-1.4.3.jar

		</pre>
		<pre>
			── img
			   ├── 00.png
			   ├── 01.png
			   ├── 02.png
			   ├── 03.png
			   ├── 04.png
			   ├── 05.png
			   ├── 06.png
			   ├── 07.png
		</pre>
		<p>
		Now all the parts of the lab are in their correct places we need to provide Cursa with meta data about the lab.
		This meta data will be put in the index.yaml file in the eclipse_tutorial directory. The index.yaml file looks like this: 
		</p>
		<pre>
		type        : Lab
		title       : Eclipse Tutorial
		courseid    :
		sectionid   :
		displayname :
		highlight   :
			- css : github.css
			  img :
		steps:
			- markdown : objectives
			  title    : Objectives
			- markdown : step01
			  title    : Step01
			- markdown : step02
			  title    : Step02
			- markdown : step03
			  title    : Step03
			- markdown : step04
			  title    : Step04
			- markdown : step05
			  title    : Step05
			- markdown : step06
			  title    : Step06
			- markdown : step07
			  title    : Step07
			- markdown : step08
			  title    : Step08
			- markdown : exercises
			  title    : Exercises
		</pre>
		<p>
		The format of the index.yaml file is auto-generated but you need to enter the names of the steps in the format shown,
		in the order you would like them to appear in the lab. Some knowledge of <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> would be advantageous but it is not too hard to learn.
		Each step here references a markdown file in the 'md' directory.
		A title for each step and a title for the lab can be added also. This will be used to generate titles for the HTML and PDF.
		The other keys can be ignored for now. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Once you have your lab set up all that is left to do is enter the build command.
		Now navigate to the eclipse_tutorial directory in your terminal and type:
		</p>
		<pre>
			$ cursa build
		</pre>
		<p>
		Cursa will check for the index.yaml file and read the meta data from it and build the lab. If successfull, you should see something like this:
		</p>
		<pre>
		$ Starting build of Lab Eclipse Tutorial

		$ Lab => Eclipse Tutorial built
		$ build completed

		</pre>
		<p>
		Cursa will have generated the HTML output in the html directory and popupulated the css and js assets.
		</p>
		<pre>
		      ├── html
			   ├── assets
			   │   ├── css
			   │   │   ├── bootstrap.min.css

			   ├── step05.html
			   ├── step06.html
			   ├── step07.html
			   └── step08.html
		</pre>
		<p>
		The templated HTML steps are now ready and can be viewed <a href="./eclipse_tutorial/html/objectives.html">here</a>.
		The steps can be navigated using the navigation bar. Another feature is that any code segments in the HTML is highlighted using <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/">highlight.js</a>
		</p>
		<p>
		The PDF that is created of the lab cab be viewed <a href="./eclipse_tutorial/pdf/Eclipse Tutorial.pdf">here</a>.
		</p>
		<h4>Topic</h4>
		<p>		
		A Topic is a higher level section than a lab. A topic is a theme or subject within our computing module.
		A Topic will consist of a collection of Labs but it will also consist of any presentations that the educator wants to deliver to the students on this topic. The educator can also outline 			the Topic learning outcomes.
		</p>
		<p>
		In our example we have our 'programming' topic which at the moment is composed of just one Lab - 'eclipse_tutorial'. Other Labs can be added to the Topic - 'Objects & Classes' for example 			- as many as the Topic requires.
		</p>
		<p>
		We will concentrate on building a Topic with just the one Lab and also one presentation. Cursa allows the user to build as many presentations as they want but in this example we will build 			just one presentation.
		</p>
		<p>
		The 'programming' Topic file structure looks like this:
		</p>
		<p class="text-error">
		  The contents of the eclipse_tutorial Lab are removed in this file structure view to make the Topic structure clear
		</p>
		<pre>
			    programming
			    ├── assets
			    │   ├── css
			    │   └── js
			    ├── index.md
			    ├── index.yaml
			    ├── labs
			    │   ├── eclipse_tutorial
			    └── presentations
				├── html
				│   └── assets
				│       ├── css
				│       └── js
				├── md
				└── pdf
		</pre>
		<p>
		Cursa created a index.md file when the Topic was scaffolded. This file is where the educator can put the learning outcomes - or any Topic level information - for the Topic.
		During the build process an index.html file will be created that will be a local interface to the Topic. The index.html file will contain the learning outcome/topic level information, 		links to any presentations that are built, and links to any labs that are built.
		</p>
		<p>
		Cursa has also created an assets directory. This will contain the CSS and JavaScript files that will be used by the index.html file.
		</p>
		<pre>
			    ├── assets
			    │   ├── css
			    │   └── js
			    ├── index.md
		</pre>
		<p>
		As described before, the labs directory will contain any Labs that are part of the Topic. When a build of a Topic is commenced, Cursa will build each Lab within the labs folder.
		Each Lab does not need to be built individually.
		</p>
		<pre>
			    ├── labs
			        ├── eclipse_tutorial
		</pre>
		<p>
		One of the features of Cursa is that it helps in creating presentations. The file structure for the presentations is similar to the Lab file structure.
		The 'md' directory will contain the Markdown for the presentation. Each presentation will be contained in one Markdown file. The HTML5 presentation output will be placed in the 'html' 		directory.
		Cursa uses the HTML5 presentation framework <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">Deck.js</a>
 		</p>			
		<p>			
		When a presentation is built, a PDF version is also created so that students can download and print off a physical copy for notes in the class. The PDF output will be placed in the 'pdf' 			directory.
		</p>
		<pre>
			        presentations
				├── html
				│   └── assets
				│       ├── css
				│       └── js
				├── md
				└── pdf
		</pre>
		<p>
		A sample Topic for you to build is provided <a href="./archives/eclipse_tutorial.tar.gz"> here</a>. Extract the folder and replace your programming directory with this directory.
		</p>
		<p>
		The sample directory matches the example described in this tutorial. It contains an unbuilt eclipse_tutorial lab and markdown for a HTML5 presentation called 'Objects_and_classes'.
		Content is also provided for the index.md file.
		</p>
		<p>
		The index.md file will contain the learning outcomes/topic level information and can be viewed <a href="./markdown/index.txt"> here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Most of the content in the index.md file is standard Markdown, but Cursa has added some extra Markdown syntax to allow videos to be placed into the Markdown.
		An educator might want to record a lecture and make it available to students online so being able to easily insert video objects would be a nice feature.
		Standard Markdown has no native syntax for including a video object into the HTML but Cursa Markdown will create a video object using its new extended syntax.
		</p>
		<p>
		There are two ways to create a video object using Cursa Markdown. The first uses a Python Markdown <a href="http://www.tylerlesmann.com/2009/apr/02/python-markdown-extension-video/">plug-in</a> from Tyler Lesmann. This method is great if you are referencing a video on one of the main video sharing websites such as

		<ul>
		    <li>Blip.tv</li>
		    <li>Dailymotion</li>
		    <li>Metacafe</li>
		    <li>Veoh</li>
		    <li>Vimeo</li>
		    <li>Yahoo! video</li>
		    <li>Youtube</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		In this case, you can just put the URL to the video in the Markdown and Cursa will recognise the URL and create the video object.
		This method has no control over the size of the video and creates video objects at the recommended size for each website.
		</p>
		<pre>
		http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMV45tHCYNI
		</pre>
		<p>
		The other option was created by the Cursa team and will be useful if the user has a video hosted elsewhere - maybe locally on your own server.
		This syntax also allows the user to manipulate the size of the video direct from the Markdown.
		It takes the form:
		</p>
		<pre>
		@(URL to video)[width,height]
		</pre>
		<p>
		Where the URL within the parentheses is put straight into the src of the video object.
		</p>
		<p>
		And the example in our sample index.md is:
		</p>
		<pre>
		@(http://youtu.be/QMV45tHCYNI)[420,320]
		</pre>
		<p>
		The width and height can be left blank and Cursa will use a default size of width:480, height:360.
		</p>
		<p class="text-error">
		  The video syntax is availabe from all Markdown content but the video objects will not render in the PDF output from Labs or presentations.
		</p>
		<p>
		Moving on to the presentations; More Cursa Markdown syntax was added to help with the creation of the HTML5 presentations.
		The Cursa program needs to know when a presentation slide starts and finishes. The delimiting syntax is 3 equal signs.
		</p>
		<pre>
		===  Start slide

		##Normal markdown here

		===  End slide
		</pre>
		<p>
		And an example from our sample presentation, objects_and_classes.md, is:
		</p>
		<pre>
===
##Objects and classes

- objects

	- Represent ‘things’ from the real world or from some problem domain

	- (example: "The red car down there in the car park")

- classes
	- Represent all objects of a kind (example: “car”)
===
		</pre>
		<p>
		The full objects_and_classes.md file can be viewed <a href="./markdown/objects_and_classes.txt"> here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Now that all the content for the Topic is created we need to provide Cursa with meta data about the Topic.
		Simliar to the Lab set-up, the meta data will be put in the index.yaml file. The index.yaml file looks like this: 
		</p>
		<pre>
		type        : Topic
		title    : programming
		courseid    :
		sectionid   :
		presentations :
		    - markdown  : Objects_and_classes
		      title     : Objects_and_Classes
		prestheme   :
			style : web-2.0.css
			transition : fade.css
		preshighlight   :
			css : school_book.css
			img : school_book.png
		labs    :
		    - folder : eclipse_tutorial
		</pre>
		<p>
		The meta data that the user adds is the name of the markdown file for the presentation. You can also optionally add a title to the HTML presentation file. 
		</p>
		<pre>
		presentations :
		    - markdown  : Objects_and_classes
		      title     : Objects_and_Classes
		</pre>
		<p>
		The presentation can be configured to have different themes (CSS styling and slide transitions).
		Check out the <a href="http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/">Deck.js</a> web site for the options available.
		</p>
		<pre>
		prestheme   :
			style : web-2.0.css
			transition : fade.css
		</pre>
		<p>
		The presentation can also be configured to have different code highlighting syntax.
		Check out the <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/">highlight.js</a> web site for the options available.
		</p>
		<pre>
		preshighlight   :
			css : school_book.css
			img : school_book.png
		</pre>
		<p>
		And finally enter the folder names of all the Labs in the lab folder
		</p>
		<pre>
		labs    :
		    - folder : eclipse_tutorial
		</pre>
		<p>
		Once you have your Topic set up all that is left to do is enter the build command.
		Now navigate to the 'programming' directory in your terminal and type:
		</p>
		<pre>
			$ cursa build
		</pre>
		<p>
		Cursa will check for the index.yaml file and read the meta data from it and build the Topic. If successfull, you should see something like this:
		</p>
		<pre>
		$ Starting build of Topic programming

		$ Lab => Eclipse Tutorial built
		$ Presentation => Objects_and_Classes built
		$ Topic => programming built

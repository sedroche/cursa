        <h2> Creating a Course</h2>
		<p>
			When creating a course there are a few concepts that you need to know. A course is divided into sections.
			A course is composed of a collection of modules, a module then is composed of a collection of topics and a topic is composed of a collection of Labs.
			Cursa allows you to create and manipulate each section independently for maximum flexibility.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cursa is a command-line application and has three commands;
		</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li><a href='#scaffold'>scaffold - creates the file structure</a></li>
				<li><a href='#build'>build - transforms markdown content into different output formats</a></li>
				<li>push - push built output to a virtual learning environment(Moodle)</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3 id="scaffold">Cursa scaffold</h3>
		<p>
			A Cursa course is a directory with a specific structure. In this tutorial, we’ll create a module named 'computing'. 
			To create this module, create a directory in your home directory called 'cursa'. This directory will contain your modules
			and the Cursa commands will only work inside this directory.
		</p>
		<p>	
			Now from within the cursa directory, type into the terminal:
		</p>
		
		<pre>
			$ cursa scaffold computing
		</pre>

		<p> The cursa program will know where in the directory structure you are and will create the appropriate course section</p>
		<p> As this is the top level, cursa will create the file structure for a module.</p>
		<p> The structure of the module is shown next;</p>

		<pre>
			computing
			    ├── assets
			    │   ├── css
			    │   │   ├── bootstrap.min.css
			    │   │   ├── bootstrap-responsive.min.css
			    │   │   └── cursa.css
			    │   └── js
			    │       ├── bootstrap.min.js
			    │       ├── highlight.pack.js
			    │       └── jquery-1.7.2.min.js
			    ├── index.yaml
			    └── topics


		</pre>

		<p>
		    Cursa has created all the relevant files and directories associated with a module. 
		    Within the computing module, cursa has created an empty topics directory. This folder with contain all the topics that make up the computing module.
		    From within this directory you can create the structure for your topics.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Now navigate to the topics directory in your terminal and type:
		</p>

		<pre>
			$ cursa scaffold programming
		</pre>
		<p>
		    This is the same command as for creating a module, but cursa knows its location in the directory and will scaffold the structure for a topic.
		</p
		<p> The structure of the topic is shown next;</p>
		<pre>
		    programming
		    ├── assets
		    │   ├── css
		    │   └── js
		    ├── index.md
		    ├── index.yaml
		    ├── labs
		    └── presentations
			├── html
			│   └── assets
			│       ├── css
			│       └── js
			├── md
			└── pdf
		</pre>

		<p> Again Cursa created all the relevant files and directories associated with a topic.
		    Do not worry about what these folders and files are for. That will all will be explained in the build tutorial.
		</p>
		<p>
		    The final section to scaffold will be a lab.
		    Cursa has created an empty labs directory within the programming directory to house the labs for the topic.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Navigate to the labs directory in your terminal and type:
		</p>

		<pre>
			$ cursa scaffold eclipse_tutorial
		</pre>
		<p>
		    This is the same command as for creating a module and topic but again cursa knows its location in the directory and will scaffold the structure for a lab.
		</p
		<p> The structure of the lab is shown next;</p>
		<pre>
		            eclipse_tutorial
			    ├── archives
			    ├── html
			    │   └── assets
			    │       ├── css
			    │       └── js
			    ├── img
			    ├── index.yaml
			    ├── md
			    │   ├── Exercises.md
			    │   ├── Objectives.md
			    │   └── RENAME-STEP.md
			    └── pdf
		</pre>
		<p>
		Cursa has now created the directory structure for the module. Each module can contain many topics and each topic can cntain many labs.
		Cursa allows you the flexibility to create whatever module structure you need. All the files and directories have a purpose which will been shown in the build tutorial.
                </p>

		<h3 id="build">Cursa build</h3>
		<p>
		The first build we will do is to build a lab.
		A lab is a practical/hands-on learning element of a topic where the student must complete a set of steps to gain experience with a subject matter.
		What happens when we build a lab is that the content - which is written in Markdown - is transformed into HTML output.
		This allows you to concentrate on creating the content and not waste time on the presentation element.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the eclipse_tutorial directory you just scaffolded there is a directory named 'md'.
		This folder will contain the markdown files that will be the source of the content for the lab.
		Each markdown file will represent a 'step' in the lab. Cursa has autogenerated some markdown files for you already.
		Each lab will usually outline the objectives for the lab and some exercises at the end.
		</p>
		<pre>
			  ├── index.yaml
			  ├── md
			      ├── Exercises.md
			      ├── Objectives.md
			      └── RENAME-STEP.md
		</pre>
		<p>
		   For every markdown 'step' in the md directory, a HTML output of that content will be generated and placed in the html directory.
		</p>
		<pre>
			    ├── html
			    │   └── assets
			    │       ├── css
			    │       └── js
		</pre>
		<p>
		   The HTML output will be styled using <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/"> Twitter Bootstrap</a>.
		   The files for which will be placed in the assets directories within the html directory.
		   The HTML output will have a navigation bar to connect the individual HTML files which will allow the student to easily step through the lab. 
		</p>

		<p>
		The 'img' directory will contain any images that you need to reference within the HTML output. Any images that you use to demonstrate the lab will be put in here.
		</p>

		<p>
		Although the HTML output is very user-friendly and intuitive, some students prefer to have a physical copy of the lab to work through.
		When a build of a lab is made, a PDF version of the lab is also generated. This PDF version will be placed in the pdf directory.
		This PDF can then be printed by the students who prefer that format.
		</p>
		<p>
		A sample lab for you to build is provided <a href="./archives/eclipse_tutorial.tar.gz"> here</a>. Replace your eclipse_tutorial directory with this directory.
		</p>
		<p>
		This sample lab contains markdown files with content.
		</p>
		<pre>
			├── md
			   ├── exercises.md
			   ├── objectives.md
			   ├── step01.md
			   ├── step02.md
			   ├── step03.md
			   ├── step04.md
			   ├── step05.md
			   ├── step06.md
			   ├── step07.md
			   ├── step08.md
			   └── step09.md
		</pre>
		<p>
		If you did not download the sample lab an example of the markdown can be seen <a href="./markdown/step03.txt">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And the 'img' and 'archive' directories contain the images and archives.
		</p>
		<pre>
			── archives
			   ├── cstyle.xml
			   ├── jettison-1.3.2.jar
			   ├── lab01projects.zip
			   ├── stax-1.2.0.jar
			   └── xstream-1.4.3.jar

		</pre>
		<pre>
			── img
			   ├── 00.png
			   ├── 01.png
			   ├── 02.png
			   ├── 03.png
			   ├── 04.png
			   ├── 05.png
			   ├── 06.png
			   ├── 07.png
		</pre>
		<p>
		Now all the parts of the lab are in their correct places we need to provide Cursa with meta data about the lab.
		This meta data will be put in the index.yaml file in the eclipse_tutorial directory. The index.yaml file looks like this: 
		</p>
		<pre>
		type        : Lab
		title       : Eclipse Tutorial
		courseid    :
		sectionid   :
		displayname :
		highlight   :
			- css : github.css
			  img :
		steps:
			- markdown : objectives
			  title    : Objectives
			- markdown : step01
			  title    : Step01
			- markdown : step02
			  title    : Step02
			- markdown : step03
			  title    : Step03
			- markdown : step04
			  title    : Step04
			- markdown : step05
			  title    : Step05
			- markdown : step06
			  title    : Step06
			- markdown : step07
			  title    : Step07
			- markdown : step08
			  title    : Step08
			- markdown : exercises
			  title    : Exercises
		</pre>
		<p>
		The format of the index.yaml file is autogenerated but you need to enter the names of the steps in the format shown,
		in the order you would like them to appear in the lab. Some knowledge of <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> would be advantageous but it is not too hard to learn.
		Each step here references a markdown file in the 'md' directory.
		A title for each step and a title for the lab can be added also. This will be used to generate titles for the HTML and PDF.
		The other keys can be ignored for now. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Once you have your lab set up all that is left to do is enter the build command.
		Now navigate to the eclipse_tutorial directory in your terminal and type:
		</p>
		<pre>
			$ cursa build
		</pre>
		<p>
		Cursa will check for the index.yaml file and read the meta data from it. If successfull, you should see something like:
		</p>
		<pre>
		$ Starting build of Lab Eclipse Tutorial

		$ Lab => Eclipse Tutorial built
		$ build completed

		</pre>
